New  York is  the biggest  city  in  the U.S.A.  It has  about 14 million  inhabitants. The  density is  one of  the highest  in the world, about 9,000 people to 1 sq km. It is sometimes called "The Big Apple”. New York  has 5 major  parts (districts): Manhattan,  Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island and Brooklyn.     Originally New  York was called  New Amsterdam, because  its first inhabitants were the Dutch. It  was a small town situated on Manhattan  Island and  surrounded by  a Wall against Indians. The wall  of course doesn't  exist now, there is a famous Wall Street in its place. Wall  Street is  known as  the  centre  of financial  life in the U.S.A., with the most important stock - exchange in the world. Wall Street  is situated in  the south of  Manhattan, while black quarter Harlem is in the northern part of Manhattan. Manhattan City Plan New York was built on a  modern plan of streets and avenues which are numbered. Streets run east-west and avenues north-south (e.g. Fifth Avenue is the shopping centre) Only few  of them have got  names e. g. Wall  Street or Broadway, which runs nearly the whole length of the island. Broadway is now a famous theatre and cultural centre.<BR>
