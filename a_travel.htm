1. part - Trip into Romania 

<br><br>
This work could be a warning for you, this story could teach you how to travel or can be just fun for you. 
My story begins on Sunday 31.8.1997, perhaps in a moment, when Lady Diana dies.

<br><br>
1.9.1997 
<br><br>
I met my friend Jacob. We answered a couple of important emails in our University. I did successfully complete registration for further semester. We bought some food, because we did not want to have empty backpacks. We left by city bus the second largest city of Czech Republic. This city is Brno. We moved southwards on motorway. Direction was already identified. It was south. We planned to move to Slovakia, city of Bratislava. We started walking but after about 20 minutes when we reached a petrol station, we found out, then we had made a mistake, because we were on a worse road. At this petrol station we learned that it will be very hard for us use this way to get to city Bratislava. Maybe it could be possible, if we went through the city of Olomouc, but this city is on a totally different way for us at this moment. 
I never thought that our beautiful and native country had another highway than from city Plzen through Prague to city Bratislava. As we learned, that we had used our energy for nothing. We had to turn back to Brno. We walked back again for about 20 minutes to Brno. We turned left. After 100 meters we reached another petrol station and my friend asked a lift to south. The driver took us to city Bratislava. He was speaking about trouble in this part of Czech Republic. We got to Slovakia and after we reached the capital of Slovakia, Bratislava. We visited Slovak's Bronx and other historical parts of this metropolis our Slovak brothers. 
Czech and Slovak Republic split to two Republics on the 1.1.1993, it was without any war how some people thought, we are not Yugoslavia, but former Czechoslovakia. We still call Slovakian people our brothers. 
We were offered a lift. We called this driver by nickname Adventurer, because he helped us as much as he could. He dropped us without reason on Slovak border with Hungary. He told us, that he would have liked to continue with us south, but he had no passport in that moment. So we got the border to Hungary. 
We passed the border and we asked a girl to take us to Budapest. But she had paperwork at border. So we have to wait for her.
So we were sitting and we were looking into the map and we are trying to get a lift into Budapest. Nobody took us. 
The girl finished the paperwork and she asked us to get into the car. After few hours she continued the other way. So we left her car on petrol station. It was our first contact with a driver who did not speak in Slav language, so we have to start using at this moment communication in Germany or in English. Slav languages are very similar. I can understand Slovak, Polish, Ukraine, Russian, Slovenian and many more languages, because they are similar with Czech. 
We reached somewhere near a town Tata Bana. We began to feel the value of a car for us. We asked a young couple, who took us to the center of Hungarian capital. We have been in Budapest. We found the pole star and got where is north to have idea, where we are, and where we are going. We crossed cuddliest bridge and fell asleep in sleeping bags over one side of the river Duane. 

<br><br>
2.9.1997 

<br><br>
It was very hard for us to get, what part of city we had been in. It was maybe because we have never been before in such a large city like Budapest. By bus we pull out through centers, but how we got to the petrol station in south part of city Budapest, we found, that we are still relatively very near center. So it was very hard to find somebody who was going out of city. So we used bus one more time and we tried to find some nice place for next hitchhiking to city Szeged. We got a lift from some young man. He has fridge on the car. After all he dropped us on road to Szeged. After that one more gentleman took us and he helped us to get better directions to south, it was very important 5 kilometres, because we had already been on the highway to south. One cowboy stopped on motorway and he said that he was going into city Subotice, but we told him, that we are going to city Szeget. After he left, we found town Subotice on map. Subotice was our destination after city Szeged, because it was in former Yugoslavia, in Serbia. If we took that lift, we could be today already in the capitol of Serbia, in city Beograd, because that driver was driving very very fast. After all we stopped a truck of a very old date of registration. Smiling man from Serbia sat inside. 
It was long, but very funny way. He spoke in his Slav language and we could understand what he is saying about his life. It was man full of experience. He was crossing often the whole of Europe. Also he spoke about mystique of southern countries. Fifty kilometres per hour we drove to the south. When we got to the border with Serbia, he told us to pack up and wait for him on second part of border. He does not want to have people in car in this moment. We reached the Hungarian custom office and we were getting stamps, we reached into the Serbian customs office and we were getting kicked out, because we did not have tourist visa to Serbia. Yep, yep this was out of mind of our new friend from Serbia. He had told us, that we could visit Serbia, but he had not told us we needed a visa. Also the travel agency told us before we started this trip, that we could visit any country in Europe without tourist visa, but they for sure forgot about Serbia. Here we got angry in most possible level. We walked back. One lady took as few kilometres away from border zone. We opened the camp in woods after that. We found out, that we had left road atlas in the car of Serbian man. We also found that we could get into Greece over Romania and Bulgaria. We opened the Indian fire to make some food. We slept well. 

<br><br>
3.9.1997 

<br><br>
We woke up in late morning hours. We left the woods and we got back on the road. We had no idea, how far we had to comeback by road to north to get some road to Romania. Maybe we have to comeback the long way to the north, who knows. We got a lift to some main road eastwards. Our mood was very low. One driver took us on junction to Romania. Friend of mine, Jacob wanted to call home, but unsuccessful, because automatic machine demanded for calling the minimum charge and he want to call collect without any Hungarian coins, because we did not have any of Hungarian coins. 
We took fresh water. We made notice "Romania" on paper to show others, where we wanted to go. Two girls were about 50 meters from us. They were hitchhiking to Romania too, but they had no reason to speak with us, because they got a lift in few minutes. After a while we saw a car, which was driving from Romania. Driver asked us, where is Hungary. In this moment he looked very funny, because he did not know where he was. He turned his car and asked us to sit. We had no idea, what was going on. My friend Jacob said to me, that it is probably the driver, who drove here few minutes ago and he comeback for us now, maybe he returned for the couple of girls in first reason, who knows. We were coming into Romania. We crossed border to Romania, but it did not looks like the border, it was like a big market. 
About 100 local men were bidding world currencies to make some profits by cheating here. We got information in customs exchange office that one Germany mark is little bit more that 4000 Romanian Lei. Really when we crossed border, it was totally different world. Everybody asked to do business with us. We felt safety because we were very near border, so a lot of policemen were around us. After this experience we stopped a local Romanian horseman with car, but we found in minutes, than it is taxi driver and he wanted money. We told him, that if he is taxi driver then he needs to have taxi schedule on his car. We did not find out even tariffs or something like this. He answered, that he is not official taxi driver, so it is cheaper for us. But we really did not want to use taxi to Athens. If we planed this trip in this way, we can use bus or plane. But we were poor students and we chose this way because it was more fun and full of experience than just boring and sitting in bus or in plane. We got other car. They looked very Christian, but they asked us for money too. We had no idea, why everybody wants money here in Romania. My friend got angry again. We started to speak about going back to civilization, it is mean to Hungary. We were planning to go back and visit Italy or other country in that moment. We discussed about this problem a little bit. I wanted to continue, but my friend Jacob wanted to go back. We were thinking of taking the train to Sofia, capitol of Bulgaria or at least into Bucurest, but it was expensive for us too. 
My friend got an idea, then we have to ask first, if they want any money to drop us somewhere. So we could continue to south. On the way into town Arad I found a full box of cigarettes, I told this to my friend that we could use this box of cigarettes to stop some smoker driver, but my friend Jacob wanted to smoke it. We got into town Arad and we reached the petrol station. 
There we found successfully another adventurer of this trip. He wanted to take us at least into further city. He took it like fun, because he had not other reason to drive into next city. And when we reached other city then he showed us history part of this city. It was city Timisvar. 

<br><br>

After that he left us alone. We found an impressive church and we sat in park, which people knew like revolutionary place of flight with communist dictator of Romania, Mr. Caucesko. We looked at some girl, who danced in the open air. Second day we found out, she should be crazy. We made a lot of new friends, who started to speak to us about the world. We spoke about our trip to Greece. We got information, that if we wanted to go to Greece, than we had to go first into Bucurest, it is capitol of Romania. We have to cross bridge trough river Duane and it is possible only over there. We spoke with a man, who wanted to work in Germany, but he could not cross border to get there, because nobody wanted to give him a visa for entry to Germany. We listened to some local music. My friend started to smoke with the others. We discuss friendly with local policemen and fell asleep. 

<br><br>
4.9.1997 

<br><br>
In the morning we woke up, but already without pack of cigarettes, which perhaps the children from previous day took. We spend many hours to get out from city Timishar. This city was without signs of name of streets, even of signs to show us, where the motorway was to Bucurest. After that we got to the motorway and we got good luck from a Romanian driver from city Oradea he invited us for a burger and he took us almost into Bucurest. After that we took a truck on the highway into the Bucurest. When we tried to ask about the historical center and any information about Bucurest we met two local university students. We bought some alcohol together and we started a party in College. One of the students was from city Constants, which is on the beach of Black sea. So we changed plans and we thought, then it could be a good idea to visit the Black sea, because we didn’t have enough time for trip to Greece yet. We fell asleep after that. 

<br><br>
5.9.1997 

<br><br>
This morning we were awaking and saying bye to our friends. We spent some time in the Bucurest, because we liked to check this capital of Romania. We were using local bus to get out of the city Bucurest. In local bus we met group of about five boys and they wanted money from us, because we did not have a ticket. They were very nice to us, because we were not citizen of Romania. They asked us for about 10 USD for penalty or we can visit police station. But we did not want to spend time in police station so we gave them about 5 USD in German currency and it was enough for them, because we were in Romania and there is was very fix prices at this time. We left city Bucurest and after a few hours we reached a tourist resort on the beach of Black sea. I called home to say hello from the Black sea. We slept on the beach with night view on the sea about 60 kilometres south from seaport of city Constants. 

<br><br>
6.9.1997 

<br><br>
This day was full of the rest. We did swimming and playing games with sands on the beach, no more major activities in this day. In the evening we started the return journey. Because we had for this trip only 2 weeks, it was just because my friend did not register himself for next semester on University yet and he had to do it before the 15.9.1997. We started hitchhiking about 60 kilometres to north back into seaport city Constants. We were looking for the way to Bucurest and also to the town Tosca, because we wanted to visit delta of river Duane and town Galati. 

<br><br>
7.9.1997 

<br><br>
This day did not start optimistically. I can say that every day started in pessimism on this trip, in negative mood, but every evening we were full of new experiences. We could not move out in this morning from city Constants. Till afternoon we were waiting on the road, but no car took us to Bucurest. We met one Romanian girl with CD-player. We got friendly and with her we successfully reached in late hours in three cars into Bucurest. Girl was living in Bucurest, so she showed us a local park, where we could spend this night. People played chess in this night for hours in this park. So I joined some games of chess. After that I went to sleep. 

<br><br>
8.9.1997 

<br><br>
In morning we found out, that somebody needed our old shoes. I had others in my backpack, but my friend was at this moment without shoes. In same moment the policeman came. We met him in the evening hours. He had found some shoes on a trailer not so far from us in market place. It was a good pair of shoes for my friend. His father later said to him, that he got better shoes there was before. We tried to use internet in Bucurest, but nobody would let us to do so. There was not internet coffee. So we continued back to north. We crossed city Brasow and we visited castle of legend vampire named Dracula. Below the castle was a small market place, which made business from legends of Transylvania. We continued to other tourist town Faragas, which one boy from Black sea beach told us to visit. We met two local girls, who were very nice to us. They spent some hours with us and after they tried to find some rooms for us in the house of some local people, but without success. They moved with us to the train station, where we could spend a safe night. 

<br><br>
9.9.1997 

<br><br>
We continued the next day to city Glus. From there we called home. I lost my watch there. Probably I left it by the phone. We took a truck to the border to Hungary. We were delayed on the way, because there was some problem on the road. And our driver had not slept for last 3 days. So he slept, when he could. It was fun to look at him and see that he was able to sleep and drive in some seconds. At two o'clock at night of Hungarian time and at three o'clock at night of Romanian time we cross the border to Hungary. We had been in Hungary. So we felt safe enough to say good night to each other. 

<br><br>
10.9.1997

<br><br> 
This day was in a mood of great depression. We couldn’t visit Venice in Italy, because we did not have enough time for it yet. I woke up in a field. I can say for sure on very special place. This place, where I woke up was exactly a place, where nobody can see you from the side of the road. So I found out at that morning, then I slept on very special place. It was a dirty place as people had used it for toilet purposes, I am sorry but it was exactly, how I just wrote. 
Place where we went hitchhiking was prohibited for 30 kilometres. So we walked the whole day. We visited restaurant. We got some soup and rest. After that we continued to walk. In the evening we made a fire and we had some supper. It was good food, so we were full of energy for next day. We reached the zone, where we could hitchhike again, so we believed, we could reach Budapest next day. By the way, this time we used other way, as when we was hitchhiking from Budapest to south, this time we want to rich Budapest from east. 

<br><br>
11.9.1997

<br><br> 
Next day we started hitchhiking to Budapest. First we had to wait for a car for a long time. Some man gave us some cookies. After that somebody from the village took us out from this crazy place. After that everything became very fast. In seconds we got another car and in a few hours we reached Budapest. After that we continued by highway to Vienna, capital of Austria. We made fire again. We fell asleep not far from the highway. 

<br><br>
12.9.1997

<br><br> 
In the morning we got very fast to Viennese airport. We washed our bodies a little bit and had some fun to get in better mood. We moved by hitchhiking to center of Vienna. It was nice to be in a clean city. We had been for long time on the highway and in Romania. We got into park of Sigmund Freud. There is we were invited by a group of our generation for the next day to the music party. We found in park the monument, which was full of old motherboards of ours lovely computers. It was funny. There we fell asleep. It was my first night in former capitalistic block. 

<br><br>
13.9.1997

<br><br> 
This day we wanted to stay in Vienna. I had been in Vienna in summer 1990 yet. So I visited Mariahilfestrasse again. It is a famous street in Vienna. That street is full of the shops. It was famous shopping street for Vienna in that time, similar to Wall Street in New York for trade market. My friend was still sleeping. I bought some CDs, videotapes, and film for my camera, because it was still cheaper there is then in Czech in that days. After we took local train together with our music group to the east part of Vienna near small lake, where we swam in the rain, smoked grass and played music. Our new friends had no spare clothing to dress, so they used our sweaters. After that we made a date for next day in park in center of Vienna and we slept in our tent, because it was raining. 

<br><br>
14.9.1997

<br><br> 
My friend has to visit our faculty for registration at next day. So we have to move from Vienna fast. But we have to wait for our friends from previous day, because they still have Jacob's sweater. After all we left address for them there is with somebody who knows them. We left Vienna, because it was already afternoon. On twice we got Czech Republic. From city of Mikulov we got another car to Velke Mezirici, it was city of my high school. I was planning to visit here some my old friends. My friend Jacob had for few minutes some problem with stomach, because he ate plums from tree on the way. I did same, but I did not have any problems. It was maybe, because I am eating many of fruits since I was very small. After he called at home and his father took us home, because it was no so far. 

<br><br>
Until the 4 of February 1998 I have been registered like student of University. 

<br><br>

<br><br>
2. part - Trip to Israel, Egypt and ... 

<br><br>
8.2.1998 

<br><br>
My friend Wenceslas flew tree weeks before me so I quickly followed him. There should be work in Israel. I bought air ticket, and I paid mediation and I flew presto to Geneva and after into Tel-Aviv. In plane I met two boys who were going with me to the same work agency. 
In Tel-Aviv we found the local agency. The Girls from this office contacted some farmer in Galilea, north part of Israel. We took the bus to city Afula. It is near Nazareth. After we called the farmer and he took us to his village. There we had to take care of his vineyard. Many times I visited Palestine villages, because this place was on border with Palestine. Palestine people are always hospitable. It is different between West and East. West people are so much more civilized. East prefers so much family. After a month we got three weeks of holidays, because vine need to grow up. My two friends from plane were going to visit Israel. And I came to visit my friend Wenceslaw to south of Israel. It is a very small country. I got a car to Nazareth Lake, so famous lake from the Bible, from New Testament. I reached Sea in a few hours too. Second day in evening I reached place of my friend Wenceslaw. I got some information about Egypt. I spent two nights there. This place is on the border with Jordan, it is the biggest moshav in Israel named En-Yahav. I hitchhiked to Red Sea. It is southern point of Israel. I visited Bedouin in his tent. Next day I crossed border to Egypt and I reached monument of St. Kathleen from 4. century below Mousses hill in Sinai. I met a group of workers in this place and they helped me to move to Cairo. I slept in a house of one of them that night.  

<br><br>
21.3.1998

<br><br> 
Next day my new friend, from previous day, helped me to visit the Pyramids and the Sphinx in Gaza (Cairo). He was catholic. I used the train to Aswan (1000 kilometres to south). I almost got Sudan, but ship to Sudan is going once in week only, so I had not time for it. I visited great Aswan dams and some sights. I met Czech group, what I met few weeks ago in Czech Republic, they are friends of my friend. They were planning this trip for years. But I did not have any idea a few weeks ago about this trip to Egypt, even to visit Israel. I was sleeping in cheap hotels. It was funny to be in this country. I could swim on the beach. I can check culture and religion. I could play games. I could drink beer or whatever I like to do here. 
I visited Kom-ombo, Luxury, Hurgada (Red sea), Suez,... I continued back to Sinai. I reached Israel by cheap taxi. It was not so far from Palestine zone of Gaza. I got a car to Dead Sea. Next day I visited Jerusalem. There I found a group of young people from Czech Republic and they showed me new information about work and living style in this country. I continued thought oldest city of world, it is Jericho, back to my farmer and my friends from farm. I stayed two more months over there.

It has so much nominal, however it is living in darkness <br>
It gives us force for live, however all the time it is dying <br>
Nobody loves us, even recovery us <br>
It is about us, but sometimes without us <br>
It have plenty of reasons, however is the only thing <br>

Tel-Aviv
<br><br>
1.6.1998 
<br><br>
I left the farm. I moved to city Tel-Aviv, largest city of Israel. I slept in a cheap hotel with other Czechs. After I met some other Czech group and I had been with them in Czech flat for 100 USD per month. I could work. It was no problem. I can work twice in week to have some money to spend. I worked in restaurant, like remover, painter,... But I did not work so much here, because I like to have some fun on the beach in the night. 
I wanted to visit Jordan or Egypt with one local girl, her name is Ilanit, but she cancelled this trip. So I left Israel. When I left the beach, the water had 32 degree of Celsius. 

<br><br>
17.7.1998

<br><br> 
I took plain into Zurich, Switzerland. I did not use my return ticket from Zurich to Prague, because I would like to visit Amsterdam and Paris. In Switzerland I met girl, who want to visit Amsterdam next day. So I spend night in her house. Next day we did stopover and we visited musical in Germany. After Amsterdam I visited Paris for few days. I checked Louver, Versailles and Eiffel tower. Paris was full of people from Slovakia, Czech, Poland and Russia. After that I returned by hitchhiking to Amsterdam, because I left my backpack in flat of one Polish girl. Next day I used hitchhiking to city Dresden. It is few kilometres from border of Czech Republic. After that I took train to my hometown. I have been for 6 months with my family and friends in Czech Republic. 


<br><br>
11.1.1999

<br><br> 
I took plane to New York. I bought a car in Virginia for 600 USD after a few months. I drove to Chicago, after Cleveland, Buffalo and visited Niagara falls, after Boston, World Trade Center in New York, Washington D.C., Atlanta,... 

<br><br>

12.12.1999 
<br><br> 

After 11 months I came back to Europe. I met some girls from Latin America in plane. I met also my friend Vlad. We celebrate together Millennium in Paris. In few weeks I was able to speak in my native language again and I made new trips such to Italy, London, Scotland and Belfast. 
<br><br> 
<hr> 
<br><br> 
3. part - Trip around the world for two and half years 
<br><br> 
15.10.2000 
<br><br> 
I spoke about this trip with Vlad for about 2 years. Date was fixed at 15. 10. 2000. Vlad visited embassy of Syria. They gave tourist visa of Syria for us. We spent last weekend in Czech Republic with group of about 5 ours friends on trip in south east of Czech Republic in country of wine. There is we met with Jana, who we met also in Egypt and Japan after. 
I got the train with Vlad. We got on the highway to Bratislava. We use same way to Hungary, like I did 3 years ago with Jacob. We pass Slovakia and in evening we went around Budapest, capital of Hungary. Second day we slept in middle of Romania. Next day we have been on border with Bulgaria. And next day we have been already in Turkey. 
We came into orient, Turkey. It was amazing. Mosques were everywhere. 
We met local police and fall asleep. Next day we started hitchhiking into Istanbul. Vlad was already here once. So we got hostel and we used internet to check emails. We did meditation in some mosques. We visited local bazaar. We got to understand, that Dagmar 
Havel was here few days ago. She was wife of president of Czech Republic in these days. After 3 days we left this almost largest city of the world and we got into Asia. Still we were hitchhiking. One of the drivers took us to original Turkish bath. It was very cold weather in these days in Europe yet. We found new summer season in south of Turkey. We entered to Syria. 
<br><br> 
About 23.10.2000 
<br><br> 
We entered into Syrian historical city Aleppo. This country looks very poor. It is interesting to have some country so close to Europe, only few hours buy car, so different like this. Totality regime has power here. People are not free and it is make them so poor. I played with local people chess and I smoked some local things. I met one local chess player. He spoke very good English. He could live in England, because his father is from UK, but he liked to study here, because it is cheaper and he had a lot of friends over here. 
One day we visited local heavy metal concert of the year 2000. This action was happened in great citadel. Music group was successful. A dancing girl with fire on the stage was something, what is for this Islamic country almost impossible. It was a group of emigrants from Syria. Now they are living in Canada and New Zealand. Some local people try to get to citadel by claiming the tall wall. Some were successful. Others were caught by local police, because they had no tickets. 
After that we used train from Aleppo to Damascus. It cost around 1 USD. We got a room in a guest house. We found out, that some tourists from Czech Republic were here, because we found 2 days old newspapers from Czech Republic. I got friendly with one girl from Iraq, who every year visited Damascus to meet some people from West. What I can say about Aleppo and Damascus. I prefer historical Aleppo. Damascus was full of rush. But maybe it is just my feeling, who knows. 
<br><br> 
About 28.10.2000 
<br><br> 
In one or two days we continued into Jordan. Vlad pukes from car. I was ok, maybe because I was drinking whole way bottle of Czech rum every day little bit. We got capital of Kingdom of Jordan, city Amman. Again we checked internet. We found, that we cannot visit Iraq and Saudi Arabia. After some days we visited Dead Sea. We bathed over there and put this healthy sand on ours skin. 
<br><br> 
About 1.11.2000
<br><br> 
We continued to south to check one of the oldest cities of the world, Petra. We visited city Aqaba. We continued in trip to city Petra next day. Vlad celebrated his birthday on local disco. I left alone city Petra. I used hitchhiking to Tel-Aviv. After 12 hours I got Tel-Aviv. I already played one of local desk game with Ilanit, my old Jewish friend, in her apartment.

What I can say about travelling by hitchhiking from Europe to Israel, it could take around 10 days without over stops and other places of interest.

After some days I met Vlad again. We were in contact by email. He called me to my mobile phone. He visited Egypt and he met without any dating Jana. She is one of girl which was with us last weekend on trip in east-south part of Czech Republic, before we left Czech Republic on this trip around the world. It is very funny to meet somebody in Africa without dating.

Vlad left to Sri Lanca, because he got angry to Jews, because they took land of Palestine. They were killing so many children without reason and maybe just for fun, how he said.
I visited with other Jewish girl for tree day's spiritual festival. About 30000 people were there, it was cool.

<br><br> 
 28. 4. 2001 
<br><br> 

I was leaving Tel-Aviv. For last 5 months I was living in Tel-Aviv. It is impossible to feel boring here. After I visited Jerusalem again. Before half year I was in Jerusalem, on the way from Jordan to Tel-Aviv, but because I wanted catch annual celebration of Love in Tel-Aviv, then I passed only this city in that time. For troubles in this area, I could not visit Palestine in this time. I was leaving again civilization. I moved into Kingdom of Jordan. 

<br><br> 
2. 5. 2001 
<br><br> 

I fly from Amman over Qatar to Sri Lanca.

I got cultural and religion shock. In only one week I have been in Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist culture.

<br><br> 
3.5.2001
<br><br> 

I met with Japanese boy, in capital of Sri Lanca, in Colombo. His name is Rei. He is still very close friend of my. We visited together fantastic city Kandy in mountains in middle of Sri Lanca. We split after that. After few days we met again in other town. Sri Lanca is very small country. I met many tourists again and again on this fantastic island. I visited town Badulla and I visited some falls with one Buddhist family. It was great, because I can check how this family feel about Buddhist religion.

In Colombo I met some guy, who call himself pilot of some airline. We drank some beers together and he told me, if I will give him some money for post stamp, then he will send some original tea of Ceylon to my family. I do not want to this, so he left me without say bye to me, because he get drank. After I found, then my friend Vlad met him also in Sri Lanca. Really, it is very small place, where is very easy to find others again and again. 

I visited south coast of Sri Lanca. There are very beautiful beaches. I have to recommend it to everyone. In this moment I have been in most south geographical width of my life, very close to south hemisphere. In this moment I turn all my spiritual energy to north to be ready to across mysterious India and be able to continue so far to top of the world.
<br><br> 
19.5.2001
<br><br> 

I took plane from city Colombo, Sri Lanca, to city Trivandrum, India. City Trivandrum is on the most south part of magic India. On bus station near airport I left my pocket with all my credit cards, money and passport, but somebody let me know about it. It was nice to know, that there are nice and kind people around me. In first moment I feel, I lost myself. I have not idea, where I have to go. What I can eat here. India is very large for me in this moment, full of the people. India is very rushed, not clean and not peaceful like Sri Lanca, where you can found streets without people. I found that it is hard to by alone in India in this moment. People speak to me, ask me for money. They watched on me all the time, because I was so different from them. They does not care, if they touch my body or asked me to give them food or drink, what I was just eating or drinking. I was very interesting for them. In United States of America it is totally opposite. People are mostly in own home. Or they are sitting in the car and they are driving to somewhere. Some Americans do not speak with you easy like people in Asia. Americans for sure say: excuse me or sorry, even if they just come close to you. America is for me very clean and very formal, it is very abnormal. But India is for me for sure very unclean, totally without basic rights, but for sure also very abnormal. India is not safety for poor reasons, but safety for religions and culture. America is not safety for rich reasons, but safety for police and very high rights of everyone. But I like to visit America and India again and again, because it is very interesting. It is like travelling in the time.
<br><br> 
So I was in India now, I was going to find my friend Vlad to Kodaikanal. I had to take train to city Madurai. Local people were very nice to me in train, so I could peacefully sleep. I did not feel any dangerous to me at first night in train in southern point of this subcontinent. I visited next day biggest original Hindu temple of south India in city Madurai. Culture and religion of Islam never touched this part of India, so I saw 100 percent Hindu culture here. I did some celebration in temple. So I am part of greatest Brahma now. I left this temple. I met one guy from Czech Republic. It was funny to meet somebody from my country in places, where is not so many tourists, because was summer and in south of India in this time is really hot for European skin. That guy took picture of me.
<br><br>
       <IMG src="foto/madurai.jpg"><br><br>
Madurai
<br><br>
After I took bus and continued to Kodaikanal. Kodaikanal, it is hill with small town on the top. Name of this town is also Kodaikanal. When I left bus in Kodaikanal then many people asked me to stay in their hostels or houses. It was happened to me everywhere in Asia, they are so poor. And tourists are very rich for them. About 1000 000 000 people is living in India. I cannot change anything with my few dollars to help everybody. I got offer to stay for 20 USD per month to have my own 2 rooms, food included. But I could not stay here for long time, so I had to say no. 
<br><br> 
I could not find Vlad. I was searching and asking for some Buddhist meditation center around here, but nobody knew about it.
Second day, it was like miracle. I found in my inbox one very old email from Vlad. There is he sent to me his phone number and address of Buddhist meditation center. The meditation center is in small village few kilometres from Kodaikanal. It was really good luck, that I never delete this email. Before I thought, then I delete this email with others emails. I called to meditation center, but secretary told me, that nobody from Czech Republic even named Vlad is there. But I want to check it by myself. I used bus and took the journey to this meditation center. I left my backpack in village. I continued to hill. I wanted to find out truth about Vlad. I came into meditation center, but secretary told me again, then nobody like him was here, for sure in last mounts. So I was asking to stay here to do meditation and I hope, than I could ask somebody from others about Vlad. He was here for months. I hope that somebody will remember him. Maybe somebody can tell me about him more. Secretary told me, than I can try to do meditation here. But I was maybe looking like somebody, who was searching just for some place to sleep. So she told me, then I have to do everything in rules of this meditation center, if I want to stay here.

Meditation
<br><br>
Several times I spoke about MEDITATION. So we stop my story for now and I will try to tell you, how I feel about meditation: LIFE, it is for me one big never terminate meditation.
<br><br> 
For me it is something that directly parries my LIFE. It is whole complex of matters, which we can pursue in the same free way with you soul like on the body in our LIFE. Major is in my opinion, how meditation can help us. Man can be reconciles, he feels loose, in fair weather, safely, untroubled. It can open new, deeper skylines, calm mind, and re-edify mental or body. Man, who identifies with self hasn't problems with life. We can try mental techs, woodwind, kinetic, dance (beautiful dance showed me one guy from Bogota, once in Amsterdam), yoga, account definite meditation and own saint confession and devotions, massage, - and how is by typing up as a matter of fact cell life, sleep. We can watch own breath, how blood circulates in us, energy (we've 7 elements). We can receive energy from universe, precinct, masses, romance and force of sea, flatus, sun, herbage, and building and after talk with people... We can use body position, which is agree with us, somebody runs with the lying position, Turkish setting position, Buddha position, in standing, ave-bell. You can watch definite your body to preferably with concentrate on two main elements - second element  (5 cm below paunches) and sixth element (third eye - between eyes) most often. Feel welcome. It is like game. Are you all right? Time can be something from 4 till 30 minutes. It is time for meditation.) You can without consequence lie and peep what arrives, and then write down, behind par days you can catch sights of, what is in largely cogitations, that is, what type me something what have value. We try to find out, what will be happened next heavy day. We can put own mind to future. We can dream about future to be ready for it. This kind of meditation I did in age of my secondary school. If I knew, who will be examiner, who will be assistant of him, what room it will be. I am in real time next day. It is next day when I have been already in own exam. I can use whole my mind for the own exam and do not need to use it for other things. 
Other interesting thing is to fall asleep in moment of thinking about something. After you can learn how to controlled own dreams, it is something, what is fantastic.
You can end in hollow, become holy, got into nirvana, but I do not want to become crazy, so I am using these things just softly and sometimes. After you can rise, because you know yourself now... Let take it like GAME, because life is GAME. It is for us. I don't think that careful and healthy meditation somebody harmed. Energy is flow around us.
I don't know what I forgot, or what I wrote wrong. This is just my general description.
<br><br>
21.5.2001
<br><br>
I have been moving to my new room in meditation center. Vlad called my name. He ran to me and said hallo to me. Secretary told me after sorry about that, but she did not found, than I was looking for him, maybe because Vlad was so long here yet and he become to be like Indian or if you want, part of this place. I successfully found Vlad.
<br><br>

Tomorrow I will leave this `Heaven` <br>
And I will go down back to `Blue planet` <br>
It is full of ordinary people, smile, dance and music. <br>
I will continue my open road. <br>
I hope I will live better, <br>
Because I changed my mind here, <br>
And now I know the way to the paradise. <br>
I can comeback any time. <br>
I will one day. <br>

<br>
1.6.2001
<br><br>

On this day Vlad and I again split. Vlad was going to Himalayas. I was going to check ashram in Auroville by train and after by bus. In Auroville I rented motorbike for 1 USD per day and I visited the city Ponticherry. Ashram in Auroville is very special ashram. It is not place for meditation for sure. It is small village in woods no so far from beach of Indian Ocean. This place looks like kibbutz in Israel. Auroville is place, where European and Indian people living together like man and woman. Population was in those days about: Indian 1200, Germany 600, French 600, British, Dutch, Americans, and Canadian...  They are living in families, working... It is good place for people, who lost reason to leave in western style. It is exactly place, where is nice to live for people who like natural things... For sure it can be nice to stay here for short time for any visitor of India. Everybody was very friendly. When I have been there, then I feel like part of this great family. It was place of smiling people, maybe because everybody found here something or somebody.
There is I burned twice my skin, one's because I have been driving so long on the sun and one's more because I have been playing with motorbike on the sand and motor of motorbike burned my leg little bit. But do not worry about it in those days. I have been in India.
<br><br>
I have been in India in monsoon time. Monsoon just starts moving from southeast to north. If I have enough of sun, I just can stay for some day and waiting for next days for monsoon. When monsoon come to me, than I can enjoy walking in the rain and after again, if I like to have sunshine, then I can move by train to north. Yes I know, it is can be funny for somebody, who is living for example in United States with A/C and never been in Asia. Just some hills like Kodalkanal, Mt. Abu or great Himalayas can save you in summer months from monsoon. So I have been moving slowly and slowly to the north of India. In same time just like monsoon did.
<br><br>
After  Auroville I moved to Silicon Valley of Asia, to city Bangalore. It is nice city in middle of nothing. It was nice to be in civilization again. It was first city what I saw in India. There are many ashrams. It is also nice weather here. I met one Indian girl. We have been together for 5 days. We have been at cinema on one american movie. She does like movie, but she was curious, about how many furniture Americans have in room, she said to me: How Americans can walk in house full of the furniture, it must be in the way. Funny, is not it?
<br><br>
I moved to town Hassan. I visited one Indian man, who I met in Auroville. Already in Auroville he gave to me just like present small packet of grass. I visited town Mangalore and Goa. I have been over there in monsoon season, so I just check the Gokarna beach, but I found out just raining and raining. I have been living for last 6 months in Israel and I already been on the beaches in Sri Lanca. So I had enough of beaches in those days.
<br><br>
13.6.2001
<br><br>
On this day I have been in Bombay. It was again one of city full of civilization for me. I visited office of Qatar airways to ask about my return ticket from Sri Lanca to Jordan, which I bought in Jordan and seller told me, then I can asked for money back for it after all, but it was not truth. Many cheaters I met on my way, one seller in Sri Lanca wanted to cheat me, but in that case I got my money back. I met one young dentist from Netherlanden, who likes to do his practice in some village in India. 
<br><br>
Zoroastrismus
<br><br>
In Asia, I was searching informations about religions. One of very interesting religion is zoroastrismus. Long, long time ago, it was religion of great Persia, but now it is religion of only several people, mainly in Bombay and in Iran. Temple of fire, temple of this religion is not impossible to visit for others religions. For this religion is very interesting, then if somebody is dead, then his body have to be put by one special man on the special tower, where birds can eat it, because it is after death only body, soul already left. So nothing wrong about it, everybody needs to eat, like somebody told me. This religion is in problems, because nobody can marry with other religion, so this small community is going down and down, because they often get marry with sisters and brothers.
<br><br>

In surprise I met one Indian in Bombay, which I met before in train. We spoke together little bit before in the train, because he was catholic. It was funny, because in Bombay is living about 10 millions inhabitants. I met other man, who show me the Bombay port and after invite me for local brandy, everybody was so happy to drink with somebody from Europe.
<br><br>

I visited center of Krishna, where people of this religions were living. I did not find anything unusually, this religion I met already many times in Israel and in other parts of the world and I studied book about this religion before. So I did not find anything new and interesting.
<br><br>

When I was moving to the north, then more and more I felt civilization. All mystic atmosphere of first days of India I slowly lost. More and more I felt atmosphere of other tourists. India was changing in my eyes or maybe I was changing in day by day and become to be local. What do you think? 
<br><br>

By train I was going through town Surat and city Ahmadabad, no one can drink alcohol here, even in the train. I met several people, who were in the earthquake in Gujarat on January 2001. With this people I played some interesting card game, but I forget rules of this game yet. We spoke little bit about earthquake too.
<br><br>

After that I got Abu Road by train. I used bus and continue to the hill Mt. Abu. I visited meditation center of Mt. Abu. I did meditation here for some days. I met one girl from Italy here. I visited several temples of sister of Buddhism, Jainism. After few days I came back by bus to Abu Road and continued to the north. I am missing Mt. Abu. I have to recommend this place to everyone, who is travelling in India. Sometimes I felt here like in Europe. Nice weather and great people here.
<br><br>

In some small village in middle of desert I learned how to be a smith. I burn my hand in that moment little bit. 
<br><br>

In Jaipur, in city of gem, I met very rich man. His father met with Bill Clinton yet. These men want to do business with me and gems. Value was about 30000 GBP and I have to send it to the London. He told me then I can make about 10000 GBP, just one problem was here. I have to give him only 3000 British pounds for these gems for starts. 
It was very nice and funny time for me. There is for sure I could buy any stone, which I like. It can be topaz, ametist, ruby, sapphire, crystals, garnet, aquamarine, citrine, emerald, opal, onyx, pearl, moon stone, period, jade, alexandrite, ametrin, turquoise, tiger eye, iolite, fluorite, blade stone, jasper, diamond, coral, tourmaline, quartzes, rainbow, essonite, sun stone, black stars, lapis, cat eye, malachite, metal gun stone, tanzanite, amber or what ever else.
<br><br>
About 19.6.2001 
<br><br>

I took the bus to Agra, city of Tach-mahal. This place near Tach-mahal was full of tourist from all nations of the world. I washed my skin in tea from some local tree to against mosquito there is. Agra is again city of gems and cheaters.
<br><br>

After somebody help me with motorbike to catch train to New Delhi. At morning in train I found out, then somebody need my very old shoes. In this morning I have not feeling to visit New Delhi, maybe I was so sleepy, I do not know. So I continued my open road to check other Asiatic religion. I continued to the north to the city Armitsar. On one train stop in town Ambala I was waiting for about 2 hours for next train and I met some local people. They give to me some local things to try, it was something like grass. In next moments I cannot believe, what was happened with me. I was almost without my mind. In this moment I met big Brahma. People around me were very worry about me, they told me, than it will be all right in few minutes. After I found out myself again and I eat some food to feel better. I cannot believe, why local people using this things, but I got big trouble just with little bit of it.
<br><br>

I took train again. It was funny. I met some couple of boys, who dress up the woman dresses and they were asking other people in the train for money for this fun. It was strange for Indian culture to see something like this. In America is impossible to see freedom like this. I played cards with local people. They were very interest about my card magic. After all I got center of Sikh religion, Golden Temple.
<br><br>

Sunday, about 21.6.2001
<br><br>

I left the train. I have been in Armitsar. It is city of Golden Temple. I was walking without my shoes, because was Sunday evening, very hard to find some place to buy some new shoes. This town is just few kilometres from Pakistan. I wanted to know if I can get Pakistan tourist visa on the border or if I want to visit Pakistan, then I have to comeback to New Delhi. I asked many people about it, tourists from Europe and Indian. I asked also in tourist office, but almost everybody told me, then I have to ask about tourist visa in New Delhi. I was walking trough town and checked my email inbox. I continued to the Golden Temple. It was easy to find it. Everybody in this city knows Golden Temple. In Europe I heard many stories about this place. I have been at front of Golden Temple.
<br><br>
Everybody have to leave shoes and backpack in storage. I have not shoes in that moment, so it was easily for me. Everyone have to use head square to hide hair. Everybody have to wash the legs in the water in front of the gate to Golden Temple. What is interesting, then some Indian people was drinking this water, because it was holy water.
Golden Temple has form of square. In middle of this square is great lake and in middle of this lake is holy place, where is in day time god of this religion, Holy Book. People were moving every evening this Holy Book to the other building, to the more safety place.
Golden Temple is taking care about everybody, cold water everywhere, food in special building, etc. There are rooms for tourists. Everything is for free. I found this place like very clean and very peaceful to take rest from travel. I can hide myself from sun here. Sometimes I did trip to city to true India. For sure it was very interesting place. I saw many people sleep in the streets of Armitsar. Golden Temple is able to give food to everyone. It is reason why so many poor Indian people were living in Armitsar.
<br><br>

One evening two Indian girls came to me. They started to speak to me. One of them was very interesting about me. She likes foreigners. She dates with me for next day in same hours in same place. But I do not know her and I wanted next day visit border of Pakistan. I want to check evening army show of peace between India and Pakistan on the border. I took bus to border in the morning. I got tourist visa to Pakistan for free. I visited Pakistan, city Lahore. I looked at night market, checking email and speaking with people about problems between India and Pakistan. I like more India. In India I feel more of freedom. I can see more colours and more kind of people in India then in Pakistan. Second day, at morning I found out, then I like to comeback to India, because I have been already in many Arabic countries and I was not interested to stay any more in Pakistan. India is India.
<br><br>

I took bus from Arabic world and got border with India. On the border I met some people from Israel, they cannot visit Muslim Pakistan, but they want to see on military Indian - Pakistan show, what was happened every evening in support of peace in those days between these countries. I moved to my base, Golden Temple, because all my staff was in the storage. In the Golden Temple I met again Indian girl, who I met two days ago. She was so happy to see me again. I said sorry to her, because I have been in Pakistan. We made date for next morning and we walked in the Golden Temple and we were speaking about everything. Next day she can spend some time with me alone, without her sister so we visited other temple in Armitsar, that temple was so similar with the Golden Temple. I got, then her name is Sarpreet and she is living no so far from New Delhi in Rajastan. And here she is only because in present she got some problem with her eye, and here in Golden Temple, they can help her in local faculty. After all I spend some time with her family, with her mother, brother and older sister. After she invites me to her home in Rajastan, but I do not know her for long time, so I said no. Next day, she left with family Armitsar. 
<br><br>
I have been for long time in Asia in these days. I have enough of this poor place, where sun is terrible in this summer months. I will be happy for some civilization, like Japan.
<br><br>

About 2.7.2001
<br><br>

I met other girl. She was Australian. She was working for some years in London and she was moving trough Asia to Australia now. We spend one evening together in Golden Temple and next day we moved to the Himalayas. By train we moved to the town Pathankot and after by bus into town Drahamsala. It is exile town of Tibetan people. It is also town of Dalailama. His 66 birthdays was happened just in these days. After few days we split. She continued to Australia. In these days I planned trip to Jammu and to Kashmir and after moved to Calcutta, Bangkok and Japan. But after all I found out, then it will be better for me to going to Japan trough Pakistan and China. Before I wanted to visit Thailand and from there I wanted to fly to Japan, but I had enough of sun, so I changed my mind and take direction to Pakistan. Where I can check also Himalayas same like in Jammu or Kashmir.

<br><br>

7.7.2001
<br><br>

I moved back to my base, Golden Temple. From holy India I was moving again to Pakistan. But how you can see, no one terrorist I met.
<br><br>

8.7.2001
<br><br>

Next day I took again bus from Armitsar to the border of Pakistan. On the border I met one Japanese girl. We spend together two days in hotel in Lahore. This town is very famous for crime to tourist. But I was lucky, because nothing wrong happened to me. After two days we split. I took train to the capital of Pakistan, to the double town Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
<br><br>

After all I was successful to find some hotel. It was not easy for me, because no so many hotels have permission to take care about western tourist. Most of hotels were only for local people. Next day I found Chinese embassy. It was interesting to check the communistic world. I met some policemen, who were living no so far from Chinese embassy. They have to take care about safety around this embassy area, where were many embassies. Many times I have been in Islamabad to visit that city. It is very interesting in psychology of world situation for next months, because middle point of Islamabad is called Point Zero, similar name I heard in few weeks again in New York, Ground Zero.
<br><br>

In Islamabad I was in middle of earthquake. In first moment I have not idea, what is happening. Land below me was moving. At that moment I think, then it is some elephant are walking around me, because elephants usually walking on the streets in Asia. But after I found out, then it is earthquake. A looked around me and checked, if is something around me, what could fall on me. But I was on the street, enough far from any building. Nothing happened to me, I will remember  this interesting moment, this power of earth, till ends of my days.
<br><br>

10.7.2001
<br><br>

Now I have to wait for tourist visa to China. I had few days to make trip out of Islamabad. I have enough of Islamabad, because it is very hot on the sun in day here. Islamabad was last city of my way with tropic weather. Very close of this city begin Himalayas. So I took bus and moved little bit to north. I had spent about 3 days in some tourist place over there in highlands. After that, I came back to the Islamabad. I pack up my Chinese tourist visa and started to move to the China. It was very dangerous road along the river Indus. River was sometimes on the road. Huge mounts were everywhere around me. After few days I got town Gilgit. It is not so far from China. In hotel I met two Belgian, who made trip from Islamabad to border of China by bike, what could be very hard for them, because border with China is 5000 meter from the sea level.

<br><br>

About 24.7.2001
<br><br>

I have to wait for next day for morning bus to China. Local people asked me for money, if they help me to cross to China illegally. I took bus to the border. Name of this place is Khunjerab Pass. This place is almost 5000 meters above sea level. I came to China without any trouble with officers. One of them asked me friendly, if the notice in Russian alphabet means same, what is on same table in English. So I have been in this time again in communist world. I mean since 17 th of November 1989, when communism fall down in Czechoslovakia. 
In the bus I met one man from Germany, he told me, then he want to visit lakes near border, because it is most beautiful place in China. So we left bus together and we visited some aboriginal people over there. We slept in the tent. In the night was very cold, because we were still about 5000 meters above sea level. Next day we visited one of family and I was dancing with one girl, who speak little bit English, because she was from city. And she studied English in the school.

<br><br>
       <IMG src="foto/china13.jpg"><br><br>
Camels in Tibet
<br><br>

After that I started to hitchhike to the city Kashi. Some aborigines gave to me some milk. It was milk from camel. So I left this romantic place, where I felt myself like in the some book-story and I slowly moved to the city Kashi. It was very terrible and old road. Many Chinese people asked in this area for money for hitchhiking. After all I got some civilization. But still I felt myself like in Europe 100 years ago. Everywhere was horses and also people were dressing like in some historic movie. In late hours I got city Kashi. I met again some people from bus, who crossed with me the border to China few days ago. Since Islamabad I was without Internet, so I also check my inbox and I have been answering some emails. I asked only one-month visa, because I found out, then one month will be enough. So I do not think about extension of my tourist visa of China. Also I found then it would be better to hitchhiking to the Urumqi and after to the Shanghai. Before I though then I can visit Tibet, but because in Tibet has very terrible roads and tourists are not so welcome in government eyes there is. Also I though then I can cross land from China to the North Korea, I move from there to South Korea by land. I wanted to take ferry from Pusan to the Japan. It was impossible in this time cross by border between North and South Korea. So I was moving slowly to the Shanghai and from there is I wanted take some ferry or plane to the Japan.
<br><br>

Next day I start to hitchhike to the north to the city Urumqi. I took road to the Akesu. I was not so far from Kyrgystan. It was not so far from Alma-Ata. I met one man from Belgium, who wanted visit Pakistan and after from there Afghanistan, he told me then it is possible. I had not idea, how long I need for hitchhiking trough all China. It is about 5000 km from Pakistan to Shanghai by road. So I choose the road, which was not so far from train, so I could anytime, if I will have enough of hitchhiking or have not time use train. I met one man, who was long time in Russia, so I could speak in Russian language with him. No so many people here are able to speak English. He was for 2 months for holidays in Southeast Asia and when he came back to the China, then China offices gave him to the jail for 2 months, because he was so long out of China. I was directed to the city Turpan. What is interest in this part of world, then it is China, but there are living people with white skin same like in Russia and they are Muslims.
<br><br>

Around the road was just desert. Sometimes was here some town along the road, only along the road, nothing more. In these towns I was eating some local foods in local restaurant. It was much better food, what I know from Pakistan, even from India or Sri Lanca. On this long way I visited some local vine festival. After that I came to the Chinese province Gansu. This province is just at in the middle of China. Everything on the west of this province was about 200 years ago Kyrkystan, Turkmenistan and other former Russian-Soviet Republic, but now it is part of great China and everything on the east from here is real China with real mongoloid inhabitants.

<br><br>

On the way were around me just desert and some oil logging towers. In one moment bus took me from the middle of nothing, where I was hitchhiking near of way toll. It is funny to have some way toll in middle of desert. Bus was empty, only driver and one girl, who were working for travel agency. She spoke very good English and she told me so many interesting things about China. This bus took me until town Jiuquan. On the west end of Great Chinese wall I celebrated my 25 - birthday. There is my own poem about Great Chinese wall from year 1995, which I translate to English now. It is interesting, how similar it was in future.
<br><br>


1.8.2001
<br><br>

I was interested about Great Chinese wall. I met some couple from Shanghai. I drank some wine. I continued to the east. China started to change. I have been in land of agriculture. All around was only corn, what will be in short time harvest. I met many people. Somebody was a driver with watermelons,... Somebody looks rich, and somebody looks poor. Somebody was working very hard on the field, somebody was working in the office. I crossed town Lanzhou and after I have been in town Xian. This city I planned visit since I have been in Pakistan. It was city of civilization. Many tourists were everywhere. Now I have been in real China. All romance and mysterious of lost world already ends. I have been in civilization. Since Israel I have been again in world of human rights. I have been again in the world of offices, formal things, in rich world full of money. I have been with my adventure in end. I started to search in the bookshops, to get some literature in English, to find some information about China and Japan, but without success. I found out, than more information in English will be in Shanghai. After that I continued by hitchhiking to city Zhengzhou. In west China I have been in main road to the east, but now around me were large cities, which was very hard to cross by hitchhiking.
<br><br>

About 8.8.2001
<br><br>

I got by train to the city of cities, to the Shanghai. I get many offers to the cheap hostels. But it was so far from center. After all I got nice room in center of Shanghai, near People Square, with cable for 6 USD per day. I found the place, where it is possible to buy ship ticket to the Japan. But after all, they told me, than I need tourist visa to the Japan, if I want to use ship. When I spoke by phone with office in Japan. They told me. I do not need to know any reason for it. So I cannot use ship to the Japan without Japanese tourist visa. It was first and also last time, when somebody from Japanese or Chinese lost face in my eyes. Or I lost face in others there is. I wanted to use ship, because it is looks more funnily. I already flu maybe 20 times, but I never use ship for more like 6 hours.
City is largest city, what I ever see. What I can prove, then I can count about 60 skyscrapers around me in center. New York City was village for me in that moment. One day I visited by subway information science fair. Other day I met one girl, her name is Kitty with her mother, they invited me to her home. We spoke little bit. China is very safety. People are very kind to tourists. 
<br><br>

23.8.2001
<br><br>

I took plane to Osaka, Japan. It is second largest city of Japan. Airport was making on artificial island. I have been for some days in the Osaka to check Japanese culture. It is take me long time to feel here like at home. Sometimes it was very hard to open some door for Japanese technology. One day I met Japanese girl. Her name is Tomoco. I booked air ticket from Osaka to Los Angeles on 26.9.2001. I met some photographer. He made some photos of me, because I have been interesting for him. He sent some picture of me after to my family to Europe.

30.8.2001
<br><br>

Since China I felt some stomach problems. It does not stop. So I visited hospital in Osaka.
They found yellows on me. They told me than I have to stay in hospital for couple of days. I felt much better after two days. They were very kind to me. They told me, than I am out of dangerous yet. Doctor told me to do not drink any alcohol for next 2 months. He told me to comeback on 5.9.2001 to check out again if everything is all right with me.
<br><br>
2.9.2001
<br><br>

I left hospital. I came to visited historical town Kyoto. I found some temples of Shintoism religion. It was interesting to see technical Japanese people and religions together. I left city Kyoto. I started to hitchhike to the Biwako Lake. It is biggest Japanese lake. I had been for long time on one place and nobody wanted to take me from here in my way. Policeman stops his motorbike on front of me. He asked me, what I am doing here. I answered, than I am hitchhiking to the Biwako Lake. He did not speak English well. I found out, than he wants me to join his motorbike. We put my backpack on his motorbike. We drove to the Biwako Lake. It was fun to be on Japanese police motorbike somewhere in Japan. His motorbike got some problem after all. We stopped no so far from lake. He told me to left him. He says to me than there is some nice place on the beach. I wanted to stay with him, but he start to call other policeman for help.
I left the policeman. I got walk to the beach. It was first time, when I have been in Japan in country side. I spend some time on the beach. After I met some Japanese people and they told me, than they will take care about me. They invite me to some hotel of his friend. It was very nice to spend time in Japanese culture in country side. In this moment, I found out, than I like to visit country side of Japan. I had enough of cities, because I spent many days in Shanghai and in Osaka before. I spent about two days here and I have to move back to the Osaka. I visited old city Nara on the way.
<br><br>
5.9.2001
<br><br>

I returned to Osaka. Doctor told me, than everything is all right. On this day I got email from my Japanese friend Rei. I met him in Sri Lanca. He emailed me, than his brother is waiting for me. I called also my friend from Czech Republic, Jana. I spent my last days in Czech Republic with Vlad and her before I left Czech Republic. How I wrote before. She was working in Japan in that time. I left Osaka again. I passed Kyoto, Nagoya. I got town Toyohashi, where I met with Jana. 
<br><br>
6.9.2001
<br><br>

I left Toyohashi. I was hitchhiking to north. I met with Amane, brother of Rei. He invites me for one week to his typically Japanese family. Amane is painter. His wife Nihon was working in hospital. It was interesting and very nice place with view on biggest mount of Japan. It is the most holy hill of Shinto's religion. Name of this hill is Mt. Fuji. I played with Amane chess. We visited his music group. Also we visited some of his friends. They lived for long time in Germany. I have visited Mt. Fuji. It was very cold weather over there for me. Amane was first who told me, what was happened in New York City on 11.9.2001. We visited Japanese beach of Pacific. I left Amane and Nihon. I took hitchhiking to the north. I have been just for few hours in Tokyo. I continued to town Aomori. Everything was fast. I took ship to Hokkaido. I have been in town Hakodate. I continued to the largest city of Hokkaido, to the Sapporo. I met two Japanese boys, who were also hitchhiking from Osaka to Hokkaido, but they need for it so many days. My new Japanese friends continued next day to the town Wakkanai. I wanted visit mysterious lake Mashuko. I visited lake with thermal springs near Mashuko Lake. It was fantastic to bath in warm lake. At night was very cold.
<br><br>

Next day I visited lake Mashuko. It was very cold day. I found out than I like to come back to south. It was nice to spend some days on this island. I have been in few hours back in Sapporo. I continued by hitchhike to the town Hakodate. I met with one man. His name is Mr. Muto. He invites me to his home. He has very nice family. He has wife and small about one year old daughter. Next day I was working in his factory. It was funny to work somewhere on lost island of Japan. We worked about 12 hours per day. After I told to Mr. Muto than it is very hard job for me and I do not want to work any more. I had very nice time here. In evenings I played with his small daughter. I spent after one day for rest in his home. Wife of Mr. Muto took me on highway to city Hakodate. It was very kind family. On the way I saw copy of Stonehenge and copies of statues from Easter Island. In night I left by ship Hokkaido.
<br><br>
About 23.9.2001
<br><br>

At morning I have been again on largest of Japanese islands. His name is Honshu. After few minutes I got again on the highway. Hitchhiking on the highway in Japan was very fast. Distance from Hakodate to Tokyo takes me only about 12 hours. In evening I slept near Tokyo in flat of one Japanese family, who invite me at home. Next day they want me to visit some other places. But I have to say sorry about it, because I have to collect my air ticket from Osaka to Los Angeles. I have been still very far from Osaka. After all I left this family. I got luck and I got Osaka very soon. Last minutes in Japan I used to call some my friends, who I met in Japan.
<br><br>
I have been in Japan on the 11 of September 2001 evening of Japanese time. It is moment of tragedy of New York City. I was writing this poem in those moments without knowing something about that terror:

I got information on Indic embassy in Kathmandu, than some brother of some Indian minister wanted visit Czech Republic about 2 months ago and Czech Republic did not give him tourist visa. And proud India got angry and they stop not give tourist visa to Czech Republic. So nobody can give me permit to visit India, because citizens of Czech Republic cannot get tourist visa to India, for sure not from Nepal in this moment. Some agency told me, than I can get tourist visa to India. So I left my passport in Kathmandu in this agency just in case of success and I took trip to Pokhara. It is second largest city of Nepal. This city is hottest than Kathmandu. I got nice hotel on the beach of local lake. I met one local man. His name is Magray. We played chess. I tried to help him to sell some things from his shop to others tourists. I helped him also to write letter to his new girl in English. I met women, who married one Germany man long time ago. She was on holidays to visit her family in Nepal now. I met Rashid. He is friend of Magray. He told me then his friend is ambassador of Indic embassy in Kathmandu. He told me, than he can help me to get tourist visa to India. It was funny for everybody, than I cannot visit India. Anybody who is citizen of Nepal can visit India without any permit. But I am white man from Europe and I cannot visit India. We left city Pokhara by bus. We have been in 6 hours in Kathmandu. We visited Mr. Nagar in his house. He told me than he will try to get visa for me. I visited about 10 times Indic embassy in Kathmandu. They told me after 40 days then I cannot get visa to India. I called Czech embassy in Kathmandu. I sent emails to Czech Republic, but nothing helps me. If I want to go to India, first I have to visit Czech Republic to get tourist visa and after I can came back to Asia to visit India. It is funny to fly from Florida to Nepal and after few kilometres from India got bad luck. After all I left Kathmandu for week to visit nation park Chitwan. I have been for 4 months in Nepal. It was interesting to be in this culture. I felt in this place like at home. I had many friends here. We played chess, cards and other games. Sometimes I borrow motorbike and I drove around Kathmandu. Sometimes I visited with my friends local casino.

I understand yet, Kathmandu, January 2003

I know yet why adjusts do not cry, <br>
Because they lost sense for fantasy <br>

I know yet why sunrise is everyday, <br>
Because so many people hope for it <br>
<br>
I know yet where my limits are, <br>
But in dreams I always levitate. <br>
<br>
I know yet how it is to kiss the woman, <br>
It is like colours of her hug. <br>
<br>
I know yet than ghosts are not exist, <br>
I did not meet anyone anywhere. <br>
<br>
I know yet how it is to feel Paris, <br>
Just how people, whom I met there. <br>
<br>
I know yet what ours dreams mean, <br>
Just gates to freedom of universe <br>
<br>
I know yet why people smile so much, <br>
Just because is sunny day. <br>
<br>
I know yet why people dance so much, <br>
They just want to forget bad things. <br>
<br>
I know yet why people think so much, <br>
Because they lost natural instinct <br>
<br>
I know yet why I love You, <br>
You are so beautiful. <br>

My generation was living there and smoking grass. Second day I took bus to city Pakxe. I did not found anything, what I could do here. It was very hot weather over here. I do not want to spend in this town even night. I met some Jewish couple and we used night bus to the capital of Laos, to the city Viangchan. I asked for tourist visa back to the Thailand and I have been for about week in north Laos. It was nice weather and fantastic place to stay. I felt like inside of some story.
